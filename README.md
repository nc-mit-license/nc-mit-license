## How to Apply in Your Projects

To use the NC-MIT 1.1 License in your own project:

1. **Copy the LICENSE file** from this repository into the root of your project.
2. **Replace the copyright line** in LICENSE:

```text
   Copyright (c) [year] [author]
````

* `[year]` → the year of your project
* `[author]` → your name or organization

3. Keep the LICENSE file **unchanged** except for the copyright line.
4. In your README or project metadata, include a note such as:

```text
   Licensed under the NC-MIT 1.1 License. See LICENSE file in the project root.
```

This ensures proper attribution, enforces the Non-Commercial restriction for free users, and allows you to legally use NC-MIT for your own projects.

## Why NC-MIT Exists

Open source has brought incredible benefits to the world, but it also has a recurring problem:
**developers spend months or years building something, only to see others take the source code, repackage it, and sell it without giving anything back.**

NC-MIT (Non-Commercial MIT License) is designed for developers who:

* **Want transparency** – making their source code available for review, learning, and community trust.
* **Want fairness** – free access for personal, educational, and research use.
* **Want sustainability** – commercial users must purchase a license, ensuring the author can continue development.
* **Want protection** – prevents others from taking the code, re-licensing it, and selling it as their own product.

This license is **not anti-open-source**. It is “source-available with clear boundaries” – you can still read, learn from, and modify the code.
The only limitation is **you cannot profit from it without supporting the author**.

In short:

> **Free for individuals. Fair for businesses. Safe for developers.**
