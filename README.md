## How to Apply in Your Projects

To use the NC-MIT 1.1 License in your own project:

1. **Copy the LICENSE file** from this repository into the root of your project.
2. **Replace the copyright line** in LICENSE:

```text
   Copyright (c) [year] [author]
````

* `[year]` → the year of your project
* `[author]` → your name or organization

3. Keep the LICENSE file **unchanged** except for the copyright line.
4. In your README or project metadata, include a note such as:

```text
   Licensed under the NC-MIT 1.1 License. See LICENSE file in the project root.
```

This ensures proper attribution, enforces the Non-Commercial restriction for free users, and allows you to legally use NC-MIT for your own projects.
